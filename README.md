# Final-Project
Python code for a wearable navigation and object detection system with haptic feedback for deafblind users.

# Python Code for Haptic Visual Sensor (HVS)
This repository contains only the **Python code modules** for HVS, a wearable assistive device designed for individuals with combined vision and hearing impairments. The code integrates object recognition, distance measurement, and haptic feedback control, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance and environmental awareness.
